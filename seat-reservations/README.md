#Welcome to the Seat Reservation System 2000

This is a revolutionary command line tool to reserve seats in a train.

The purpose is for you to improve your pure programming skills.

Watch out Deutsche Bahn!

###Your first challenge

The first iteration of this app consists of the following user stories:

_As a passenger, I want to reserve seats on the train so that I can sit with my
homies. And of course I want to know the number(s) of the seat(s) I reserved,
duh._

_As a Deutsche Bahn personnel, I want to get a list of the seats that are
reserved so that I can mark them in the carraige with a little 'X' so that
those freeloaders who don't pay to reserve seats don't stop me from making my
millions._

###Here's how you are going to do it

Fork this repository, then clone it to your local machine. Don't forget to
commit small chunks of progress.

It's a ruby app, so we've provided you with a ruby script that handles the
commandline input and output. Run:

	> ./reserve.rb

You will get a prompt, and it works like this:

	Welcome to the SRS 2000!
	How many seats do you want to reserve?
	2  <-- your customer enters this
	Your reserved seat numbers are:
	12,13 <-- your program calculates this

If you run the other script `list`, it will list all the seat numbers that are reserved, eg.

	> ./list.rb
	The following seats are reserved:
	1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13

That means seats 1-13 have been reserved. For now the carriage has 20 seats in
rows of 2. You can allocate the seats just sequentially for now, nothing fancy.

If the customer tries to reserve seats and there are none left, you should do
something sensible, since there is not yet a standard protocol for issuing
electric shocks via the command line.

###Getting Started

If you look at the scripts `reserve.rb` and `list.rb`, you will see that we
expect you to build a class `ReservationService` that provides two core methods
to interact with the reservation system.

We have created a test suite in `spec/reservation_service_spec.rb` to get you started.

It uses Minitest â€“ the standard unit testing framework that comes with ruby
these days. You can run the tests with:

	> ruby spec/reservation_service_spec.rb

The tests are marked with `skip`. Here's how we suggest you develop:
remove `skip` from the first test, run it and see that it fails.
Implement the code to make it pass. Commit your changes to git. Repeat
for the next test until all tests are running and passing.

Feel free to add more tests and classes to the ones we'e provided.

You can [find all available assertions here](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/minitest/rdoc/MiniTest/Assertions.html).

The only requirement is that you pass the existing tests and have the scripts
working as above. You are free to add other files/classes/tests.

When you are done, we'll extend your contract and give you your next assignment!
